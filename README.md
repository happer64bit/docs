## Develop & Preview

This site makes use of [Eleventy](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy) for compiling the markdown files to HTML. [WebPack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) takes care of bundling and transpiling the assets (SCSS, JavaScript).

npm run watch
```

This will start watch modes for both Eleventy and WebPack.
Your terminal will print the exact `localhost` URL where you can preview your work.
